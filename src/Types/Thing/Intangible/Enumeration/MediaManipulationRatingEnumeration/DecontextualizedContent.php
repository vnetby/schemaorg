 * Content coded 'missing context' in a [[MediaReview]], considered in the context of how it was published or shared. For a [[VideoObject]]
 * to be 'missing context': Presenting unaltered video in an inaccurate manner that misrepresents the footage. For example, using incorrect dates or
 * locations, altering the transcript or sharing brief clips from a longer video to mislead viewers. (A video rated 'original' can also
 * be missing context.) For an [[ImageObject]] to be 'missing context': Presenting unaltered images in an inaccurate manner to misrepresent the image
 * and mislead the viewer. For example, a common tactic is using an unaltered image but saying it came from a different
 * time or place. (An image rated 'original' can also be missing context.) For an [[ImageObject]] with embedded text to be 'missing
 * context': An unaltered image presented in an inaccurate manner to misrepresent the image and mislead the viewer. For example, a common
 * tactic is using an unaltered image but saying it came from a different time or place. (An 'original' image with inaccurate
 * text would generally fall in this category.) For an [[AudioObject]] to be 'missing context': Unaltered audio presented in an inaccurate manner
 * that misrepresents it. For example, using incorrect dates or locations, or sharing brief clips from a longer recording to mislead viewers.
 * (Audio rated “original” can also be missing context.)
