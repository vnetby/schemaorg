/**
 * @see https://schema.org/CampingPitch
 * A [[CampingPitch]] is an individual place for overnight stay in the outdoors, typically being part of a larger camping site, or
 * [[Campground]].\n\n In British English a campsite, or campground, is an area, usually divided into a number of pitches, where people can
 * camp overnight using tents or camper vans or caravans; this British English use of the word is synonymous with the American
 * English expression campground. In American English the term campsite generally means an area where an individual, family, group, or military unit
 * can pitch a tent or park a camper; a campground may contain many campsites. (Source: Wikipedia, see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campsite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campsite).)\n\n See also the
 * dedicated [document on the use of schema.org for marking up hotels and other forms of accommodations](/docs/hotels.html).
