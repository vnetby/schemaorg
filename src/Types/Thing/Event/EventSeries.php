/**
 * @see https://schema.org/EventSeries
 * A series of [[Event]]s. Included events can relate with the series using the [[superEvent]] property. An EventSeries is a collection of
 * events that share some unifying characteristic. For example, "The Olympic Games" is a series, which is repeated regularly. The "2012 London
 * Olympics" can be presented both as an [[Event]] in the series "Olympic Games", and as an [[EventSeries]] that included a number
 * of sporting competitions as Events. The nature of the association between the events in an [[EventSeries]] can vary, but typical examples
 * could include a thematic event series (e.g. topical meetups or classes), or a series of regular events that share a location,
 * attendee group and/or organizers. EventSeries has been defined as a kind of Event to make it easy for publishers to use
 * it in an Event context without worrying about which kinds of series are really event-like enough to call an Event. In
 * general an EventSeries may seem more Event-like when the period of time is compact and when aspects such as location are
 * fixed, but it may also sometimes prove useful to describe a longer-term series as an Event.
